Linked List and Word finder

EX1 is a Linked List by creating a Node Class using C++. It will take in a file, this case Perm50.txt,
and will fill up the singly linked list. It will then print the numbers in the order they enetered
the linked listm. Next it will sort the linked list in ascending order.

EX2 is a word finder using a mixture of C and C++. It first take in a user specified file and try to open
it. If the file is not able to be open then an error message will show up. Next, it will ask the user
to enter the word that they are looking for. It will then look and print out every instance of the word
and print out the amount of times the word came up.
